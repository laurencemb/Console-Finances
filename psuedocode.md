1)- create a variable to store the total number of months in the dataset 'datasetTotalMonths' (tick)
2) Use array length function to log the total months to the console using datasetTotalMonths (tick)
3)- create a variable to store the total amount of profit/losses over the entire period. 'overallTotal' (tick)
4)- create a for loop targeting the profits/losses dimension of the array - use it to create a total of all the months. (tick)
 5) print to console using 'overallTotal' (tick)
 6) create another for loop targeting the profits/losses dimension, use it to create a new array of the changes per month. 'monthlyChanges'
 7) create a variable to store the average monthly change - 'averageMonthlyChange'
 8) use for loop to access the monthlyChanges array create sum and divide by total - print to console using 'averageMonthlyChange
 9) Use for loop to find highest value increase. compare array position with finances array and print to console month of the change and the profit. 
 10)Use for loop to find biggest value decrease. compare array position with finances array and print to console month of the change and the loss.
